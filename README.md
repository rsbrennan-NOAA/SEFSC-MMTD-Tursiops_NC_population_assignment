I have taken 3 main approaches:

1. [rubias](https://github.com/eriqande/rubias)
2. [assignPOP](https://alexkychen.github.io/assignPOP/)
3. DAPC

Of these, I think either rubias or assignPOP should be used. The major difference between the two is that rubias uses a baysian assignment approach whereas assignPOP uses machine learning.
